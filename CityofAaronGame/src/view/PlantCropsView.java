//User enters a value.
//Check to make sure that the value is positive. If it is not, show a message and ask the user to enter the value again.
//Check to make sure the city has this much land. If not, show a message and ask the user to enter a new value.
//Make sure that the city has enough wheat in storage to plant this many acres (You can plant 2 acres with one bushel of wheat). If not, show a message and ask the user to enter the value again.
//Make sure that the city has enough people to tend the land. One person can take care of 10 acres. If there are not enough people, show a message and ask the user to enter a different value. ~~Note: this requirement has been moved from the "Buy Land" menu.
//Calculate the number of bushels required to plant the crops.
// save acres number to WheatControl.setAcresToPlant()
// save wheat bushels as seed number to WheatControl.setAcresToPlant()
// DURING LIVE THE YEAR >>>
//Subtract this amount from the wheat in storage. Display the amount of wheat you have left.
//Update game state to save how many acres have been planted.
